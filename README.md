# Simplified Saaze

_Simplified Saaze_ is a fast, all-inclusive, flat-file CMS for simple websites and blogs.

Static site builders are fast but normally have a steep learning curve and require lots of tooling to make them work. We believe building a personal site should be stupidly simple. That's why _Simplified Saaze_ is built on the following principles.

* Easy to run - All you need is [PHP8](https://www.php.net), a C compiler, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* Easy to host - Serve dynamically or statically
* Easy to edit - Edit content using simple Markdown files
* Easy to theme - Templates use plain PHP/HTML
* Fast and secure - No database = less moving parts + more speed
* Simple to understand - Everything is a collection of entries

For more info and documentation for the original Saaze see https://saaze.dev.
