There's one life skill that is extremely valuable that will serve you in all of life, and that is to be able to recognize when somebody's actions or words are triggering something deeper inside of you.

It's easy to think and feel like somebody's words or actions are giving you these feelings, but if you dig deeper and learn to be more self-aware, you can differentiate when you are being triggered, which means when something from your past is being brought up, versus when you really are just reacting to their words or actions.
And a great way to figure out if you are being triggered is if your reaction does feel like crazy, crazy big to what was happening.

It doesn't mean you're overreacting; it just means that there's something much deeper going on.
