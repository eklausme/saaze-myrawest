Good morning! I woke up about five minutes ago, so I'm very tired, but also this is a slow Saturday morning where I got to sleep in as long as I wanted. I'm going to do just a really slow morning routine that feels healthy and, full of, like, self-care. So, if you want to spend a morning with me, a very slow morning, and this video—the intent is just to watch it in the morning, follow along, and, and it's supposed to be we do it together. And I actually have a goal to watch it myself on those mornings when it's hard to wake up, slow mornings, and you're feeling a little depressed in the morning. So, yeah, first things first, I'm going to sit up and drink the water that's beside my bed. Water—I drink water in a wine glass to feel fancier. If you have water, drink some water. If you don't have water, go and get some water. Drink it.

The idea of this video is based on the last video that I posted about how I can't handle silence and I can't handle just spending time with myself. So, I figured I could record a slow morning video, and then I could listen to it myself, and it's basically like spending time with myself, but just spending time with a video of myself. Maybe that's cheating, but it's kind of a way to experience silence, but also be with someone. So, I'm going to have a lot of moments of silence in this video.

The next thing I'm going to do is make some tea. That is a little bit outside of my routine, but I do love to make tea. So, if you have coffee, you know, if you have coffee at home and you need to make coffee in the morning, make some coffee, and I will make some tea. Okay, one, two, three, go! This one we're going to have to pause the video.

Okay, yeah, clear winner! There's a clear winner today. This is my favorite tea. I love it. For it says on the bag,
> "Be Fearless, know that all will be provided at the right time."

It's kind of a weird one, "provided," like provided by the universe or God, depending. I don't know if I believe in "provided," but I do think kind of another way to think of that is, you are where you're supposed to be. You're always where you're supposed to be.


## The brain in the morning

Okay, I'm going to let the tea cool down, and next thing I'm going to do is journal. Gosh, show my face! And I'm very excited. I got a new journal. So, spend the next 15 minutes journaling and drinking some tea or coffee. You have the most power and control over your day right now. When you wake up, right when you wake up, your brain has the most, calm. It's in the most calm state. It feels ready to focus, it feels the most amount of brain power to make decisions and have self-control. As your brain gets tired, you lose all those things. So, right now is the most important time to put yourself on the right track for the day.

For we did it! I journaled two and a half pages. Not really sure what to do next in my routine. Maybe this could be the end, but I'm really happy that I started the day mostly in silence and not consuming endless videos. And because we've started out on the right track, possibly we can keep it going. We have the most power and control right now. So, if we end this video, don't go on to other videos. Just feel the silence and the slowness and be present. I'm learning kind of since the concussion, but just in general, that there is a certain feeling of dissociation, or a disconnect of your mind and your body, your brain and your body, and your brain, yeah, anyway.

And I think endlessly being on our phones and consuming endless content takes us out of reality so deeply, where you can get off your phone for a second and just kind of be like,
> "Where am I? What's going on?"

Like everything feels so disorienting for a while if you pay attention. And you might realize, maybe it's only true for me, but for me, I realized is that on those phone-heavy days, it feels like I am living in a daze, and it feels like I'm living in a dream, and that reality is kind of dreamlike because my focus has been on my phone all day. And when I'm experiencing life or doing things in life, I'm still on my phone, so I'm not actually experiencing reality, and it's really bad. I think it's a big reason that people say time goes fast. I mean, obviously only for, like, the last 20 years, but it's definitely making my life go faster, that's for sure. I'm going to make my bed and clean my room as kind of the first thing today, if anyone wants to do that, water my plants, and then I'll start my actual day.

I'm not sure what I'm doing today, but we started it on the right track. Yeah, feel free to start your morning with this video anytime you want. That's the intention, and I think I'm going to do it too.

Bye!
