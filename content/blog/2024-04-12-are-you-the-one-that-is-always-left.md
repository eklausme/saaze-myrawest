I've been having a harder time the last week with the breakup, and I was thinking about something, which is that I was feeling sorry for myself and thinking,
> "Why is it that every man leaves me? Every man I like, every man I've been with, they initially are interested, and then they decide they don't want me, and they leave."

And, like, obviously, that can make you feel like something's wrong with you, which there are some things wrong with me.
But I thought of something that was helpful, which is: I could have left them at any point because they had red flags as well.

Like, in every instance, I was putting up with a lot.
Like, they were mistreating me and disrespecting me.
One of them cheated on me â€” things like this.
And that should have made a person leave.

So I could have left them; I'm left by choice.
