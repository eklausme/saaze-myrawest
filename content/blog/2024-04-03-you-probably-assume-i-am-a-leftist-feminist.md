So, you probably assume, based on my hair, that I'm a crazy feminist.
But actually, I am a born-again Christian.
I believe that women should submit to their husbands.
I believe that a woman's purpose is to get married and have children.
Uh, I believe that women should dress modestly and have a submissive and quiet spirit, and a humble spirit.

Just kidding! I'm a feminist.
