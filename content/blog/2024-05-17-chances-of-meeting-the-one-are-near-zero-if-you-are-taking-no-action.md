Here's a continuation of a thought that I shared about how there's almost no chance that I'm going to meet a man in public when I'm just out and about doing nothing.
It is when I'm out and about, and I start to fantasize about,
> "Oh, what if that guy riding the bike is my future husband?"

And then I start to get all that ... like, I ask myself,
> "Are you going to go talk to him?"

And I'm like,
> "No."

And then I'm like,
> "Okay, then he's not the one."

Because there's pretty much a zero chance that he's going to approach you and have a conversation with you.
So I'm learning that it's up to me, or it's not going to happen.

Or, more importantly (ignore the mess), more importantly, it's about how I need to just go out in more social situations, like groups and sports and hikes, group hikes and group traveling things, and different events. I have to go and be more social than just expecting a stranger to come.
