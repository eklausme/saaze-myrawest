I'm 21 years old and I have no friends,
and I'm just gonna go into why that is.

Tonight I'm extra lonely, just out and
about by myself as always, and I'm just
gonna make a video about why I have no
friends and I'm gonna start from the
very beginning.

So once upon a time when
I was born 21 years ago.
My parents
thought it was a great idea to not
socialize me as a child.
Meaning, that we were a homeschool family,
and I was the second to last child, which
if anybody knows, the second to last
child of eight children.
Anybody, who knows or who's in a big
family, knows that parents put in less
and less effort with each child, and
after child number three it gets pretty
neglectful.
So the older children got
socialized.
They got to do things and I
grew up from age zero to five with not a
single friend.
Not a single friend.


## Church

We went to a church which had a bunch of
people, but they were all old people.

I remember old people and I remember I
tried to make a friend with a girl, and I
was chasing her around saying hi, hi, at
five years old or four.
And that didn't work out so well.

Then from age five on I remember feeling so jealous at that.

I remember being
so jealous of my older siblings, an older
sister in particular, because she had
friends, because she went to
this group, which was made for teenage
girls.
So she got to hang out with a
bunch of teenage girls her age and I
remember every time we drop her off and
pick her up.
I felt so jealous that she got to go and
I didn't because I wanted friends and I
was lonely.
And I also remember this time
when I was following my brother around
when their friend would come over, who
was a guy and they would exclude me
completely.
Sometimes just telling me to
leave or just completely ignoring me,
because I was the little sister.
So that
was my experience from age zero to five.
Then we moved to Wisconsin to a teeny
tiny town.
And from five to twelve I also
didn't have any friends.
They really
didn't think it was important to
socialize me with anybody.

We did go to
church and I was pretty shy.
And again,
there wasn't really anybody my age,
because I don't know, if people know this,
but first of all when you're young, like
from age five to twelve, you're
kind of in this awkward age group. where
the teenagers are cool and like the
teenagers won't be friends with you,
because they're teenagers and it seemed
like there was only teenagers at that
church.
Teenagers and older people
just ignored me, like nobody talked
to me.
Basically from zero to
twelve, zero socialization.
As a homeschool family we didn't do anything.
I mean what is there, where would a
family go, to make friends.


## Public school

So, I grew up extremely alone and just
far away from all civilization.
Obviously, that probably didn't help my
social skills.
Then after age 12, I
got put in public school, which was good.
This is kind of where it gets tricky.
I don't know why, I didn't make friends.
I mean every day in high school
I had friends. I had pretty good friends,
like I would call them friends.
I would never call them close friends, but I hung
around with a group of girls and the
best thing about high school was that
there was no drama for me.
None at all.
I wasn't included in any drama and it
seemed like it was because everybody,
every single person, including my friends,
kept a distance from me.
I don't know why that is.
I really don't know what is with me that people kept a
distance.

I remember one girl really hated me for
a couple years.
But for the last couple
years of high school, we were great.
But at one point she really made it seem
like I was super stuck-up, and she just
thought that I was proud and stuck-up,
which I won't defend myself.
But I don't think I am.
I think it was because I'm shy.
So sometimes people
misinterpret shyness and quietness
for being judgemental.
So when
somebody's really quiet, you assume
they're being judgmental of you.
Actually I know that firsthand because
there was a girl in high school, who was
super quiet around me and I really
thought she was judging me hardcore.
I have no idea if she was or not to this
day.
She might have been, but I
absolutely believe she was judging me.
But anyway, I just don't know what it
was about high school.
I don't know if I
didn't have social skills or what.
<!-- but like here how it was -->

In high school I felt like I was friends and on good
terms with everybody, like everybody was
my friend, everybody would talk to me.
There was no drama.
Nothing bad happened, but at the same
time no one was close to me.
I don't know if it was me.
I don't know if I didn't let anybody close to me.
I think at the time, I mean obviously pretty much
every high schooler will say this, but it
was a very like depressed and dark
period of life.

In high school everybody's
like depressed, but I was especially
depressed and maybe I just wasn't
letting anybody in.
I don't know what another thing was: I always felt like I
was in too much pain or I was too
complicated for anybody to really
understand, so I probably didn't try that
hard, because I always felt
like I was going through more and had
harder problems than other people.
Which I know that probably sounds horrible, but
I think almost everybody can feel that
way about themselves.
I guess that might be part of it.

Another thing was, I didn't feel
like I connected with anybody and since
it was such a small school, I only had
twenty classmates.
I think that was
also a part of it, because how are you
expected to find like a great friend out
of 20 people.
I honestly don't think too
many people did find good friends in that tiny school.


## Homecoming queen

I'm gonna wrap this up.
After high school I graduated and
I won [homecoming queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_Queen_(disambiguation)).
So, I wasn't unpopular. I'm just saying
like that as an example as a proof that
that I wasn't hated in high school.

Everybody liked me, but somehow I just
didn't make any friends. I was
homecoming queen, but anyway, I didn't make any friends that lasted.
I really wanted to &mdash; but maybe not, maybe not with anybody at that school.
I think
it was just because I didn't feel like I
connected with anybody.
Maybe they
sensed that as well.

Anyway, I graduated. None of my friends stuck with
me. I actually didn't see anybody after
high school except for one person. So I
didn't see anybody really after high
school. Nobody really talked to
me and I have reached out to a
couple classmates and they all said that
they have lost track with each other too.

So everybody has lost track of each
other, which, I guess, people I guess it
happens when people graduate high school.

I didn't go to college
because I was terrified to, and I felt
inadequate and I felt like I couldn't do
it and I was stupid and I would never
pass. I felt really intimidated.
* I was terrified of college students.
* I was terrified of the process.
* I was terrified of the money and the debt

So I didn't go to college.


## Making friends

So, obviously, I
haven't made any college friends.
Then it's like, well, how do you make
friends? Then you've got only the option to
make friends as co-workers and like
going. I don't know going to some kind of
class or group or something but in
church. So after or during this time
after graduating I've tried everything.
I've gone to church. I've tried to
go to church and find people to be
friends with. I've joined Meetup and I've
done a couple meetups.
I've reached out to people to
try to go to coffee.

Well, what else have I done?
I don't know, but with my work friends I never really made
friends at my last job.
Not really at any job.
It's the same thing. I don't know
what it is with me. I truly don't.
I must be completely blind to
myself, but I have no idea why people
don't want to be friends with me.
Like even people that I do very much like.
When I find somebody that I do very much
like and I want to be friends with and I
reach out to them, and I'm trying my best
I'm being friendly and inquisitive and
asking about them and like really trying
like putting an effort to be friends and
it doesn't happen. When I find
somebody that I think is super cool,
which is pretty rare, but it's like
they're too cool for me.
I don't know.
I really I mean, honestly, if anybody knows.

I'd love to know why people aren't
friends with me.

Recently I went to
a meet-up and I met a girl that I loved,
I just loved her. I thought she was super
cool and I wanted to be friends, but it's
like you meet her, you talk, you talk for
hours the day, and then nothing happens.
Nobody reaches out to anybody. I'm too
afraid to. It happened again on a
different meetup, where I went to coffee
with a lady and I talked to her for
hours, like many, many hours. The
conversation just flowed, and nothing
came of that either. Nobody has reached
out to anybody and I'm too scared to,
because she's too cool. I don't know, but
anyway, the moral or what it all comes
down to, is that I'm 21 years old and I
have no friends. No friends at all.
And might I add that my relationship
with my family is non-existent, so I have
no support system, no friends, nobody to
turn to, nobody to hang around.
Nobody to do fun stuff, with nobody to
vent to. Nobody to count on and nobody's
there for me. I've always been
alone my entire life, my entire existence.

I've been alone and it bothers me so
deeply, because all I ever have wanted is
people in my life and friendships in my
life and good connection and close
people. I don't know why it doesn't
happen. I don't know
and it's pretty hopeless. It's pretty
depressing because I'm so sick of going
around and living my life completely
alone.


## Final thoughts

Anyway, that's it. I mean I was
maybe supposed to say something
uplifting at the end. But there really
isn't. I mean I wasn't coming to any kind
of point. I was just doing a timeline of
my life without any friends and that I
don't have friends now, and that I've
been trying, and it's super hard

But I guess, the final thing is that I'm
fine.
I'm good with being alone as in I can
survive. I have a really good mental
mindset at this point in life. I've
really learned a lot. I think I'm
strong and capable to get through it.
I think being alone is beautiful in a
way, and that you can only count on
yourself and everything. So I'm
getting through it, but I just want
things to change, you know, want things to
change.

Feel free to comment and if you made it
through the video I'll give you a prize,
which I don't have but I just wanted to
say that,
congratulations. I bet nobody has. If
anybody has made it to the end, comment
"Pizza" in the
comments.

If you finish this video and I
will, I don't know, I'll think that's
great I'll make my day because I'm
confident nobody will make it this far. I
don't even think anybody would click, but
yeah, I'm kind of to the point like of
desperation, where I'm reaching out to
the whole vast majority of the
populace of the world, just kind of like
begging for somebody to give a damn. You
know, like, I think a lot of people reach
that point, where they're like nobody
cares, like nobody is in my life and
completely alone in the world I have no
support and I'm just kind of reaching
out to the world for some kind of
support anyway.

Goodbye.
